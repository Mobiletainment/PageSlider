## PageSlider (stand-alone version without jQuery dependency)
This fork of @ccoenraets much-loved [PageSlider](https://github.com/ccoenraets/PageSlider/) comes without a dependency to jQuery.
Hence, it combines plain and lightweight JavaScript with powerful and hardware accelerated CSS transitions.

In addition, the demo has been modified to run without Cordova and Fastclick.

Many thanks to the author of PageSlider, [Christophe Coenraets](https://github.com/ccoenraets).
